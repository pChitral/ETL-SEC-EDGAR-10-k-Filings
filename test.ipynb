Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the subsection entitled “Risk Factors” above, which are incorporated herein by reference. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. All information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references in this report to particular years or quarters refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Executive Overview The Company designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers, portable digital music players, and mobile communication devices and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company’s products and services include the Mac line of desktop and portable computers, the iPod line of portable digital music players, iPhone, Apple TV, Xserve, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the Mac OS X operating system, third-party digital content through the iTunes Store, and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Mac, iPod and iPhone compatible products, including application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and peripherals through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumer, small and mid-sized business (“SMB”), education, enterprise, government, and creative markets. 36 Table of Contents The Company is focused on providing innovative products and solutions to consumer, SMB, education, enterprise, government and creative customers that greatly enhance their evolving digital lifestyles. The Company is the only participant in the personal computer and consumer electronics industries that controls the design and development of the entire personal computer, including the hardware, operating system, and sophisticated software applications, as well as the design and development of portable digital music players, mobile communication devices, and a variety of products and solutions for obtaining and enjoying digital content. The Company is therefore uniquely positioned to offer superior and well-integrated digital lifestyle products and solutions, which are further enhanced by the Company’s emphasis on ease-of-use and creative industrial designs. The Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including personal computers with its Mac line of personal computers, consumer electronics with its iPod product families, mobile communications with iPhone, and distribution of third-party digital content through its online iTunes Store. While the Company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the personal computer and consumer electronics markets as well as a leader in the emerging market for distribution of digital content, these markets are highly competitive and subject to aggressive pricing. To remain competitive, the Company believes that increased investment in research and development and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain or expand its position in the markets where it competes. The Company’s R&D spending is focused on further developing its existing Mac line of personal computers, its operating system, application software, iPhone and iPods; developing new digital lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas and technologies. The Company also believes increased investment in marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand awareness. The Company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration, demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available only on Mac computers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the Mac with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company had 247 stores open as of September 27, 2008. The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales, including the Apple Sales Consultant Program, which places Apple employees and contractors at selected third-party reseller locations. The Company believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an efficient way to demonstrate the advantages of its Mac computers and other products over those of its competitors. The Company also sells to customers directly through its online stores around the world and through its direct sales force. The Company’s iPods are sold through a significant number of distribution points to provide broad access. iPods can be purchased in certain department stores, member-only warehouse stores, large retail chains, and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels for Mac distribution listed above. iPhone is distributed through the Company, its cellular network carriers’ distribution channels, and certain third-party resellers. The Company has signed multi-year agreements with various cellular network carriers authorizing them to distribute and provide cellular network services for iPhone 3G in over 70 countries. These agreements are generally not exclusive with a specific carrier, except in the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Spain, Ireland, and certain other countries. The Company expects to ship iPhone 3G in over 70 countries by the end of calendar year 2008. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts 37 Table of Contents reported in its Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. Management believes the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, music products, digital content, peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue for software products (operating system software and applications software), or any product that is considered to be software-related, in accordance with the guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) No. 03-5, Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Non-software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software, (e.g., Mac computers, iPod portable digital music players and iPhone) pursuant to American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) Statement of Position (“SOP”) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended. For products that are not software or software-related, (e.g., digital content sold on the iTunes Store and certain Mac, iPod and iPhone supplies and accessories), the Company recognizes revenue pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104, Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. For both Apple TV and iPhone, the Company has indicated that from time-to-time it may provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers. Therefore, sales of Apple TV and iPhone handsets are recognized under subscription accounting in accordance with SOP No. 97-2. The Company recognizes the associated revenue and cost of goods sold on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated 24-month economic lives of these products, with any loss recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred by the Company for engineering, sales, marketing, and warranty are expensed as incurred. The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Company’s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at 38 Table of Contents which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company’s historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company distributes its products through third-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and enterprise customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company’s direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit-risk-sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company’s distribution and retail channel partners. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management’s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that it reasonably believes to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors, including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the Company’s distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customer’s financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit-worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made. Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communications industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Company’s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs, which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs were recorded. The Company accrues reserves for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Company’s requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company’s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company’s products, the Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded. 39 Table of Contents Warranty Costs The Company provides for the estimated cost for hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company’s typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. For products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No. 97-2, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the Company’s results of operations. The Company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the software’s compliance with specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award’s fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) option-pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The BSM option-pricing model requires various judgmental assumptions including expected volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected option life. Significant changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the fair value of stock-based awards granted in the future. Income Taxes The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. Effective at the beginning of 2008, the Company adopted Financial Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. Further information may be found in Note 5, “Income Taxes” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of FIN 48 and other complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies As discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Note 8 “Commitments and Contingencies” in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is subject to 40 Table of Contents various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, the Company records a contingent liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In management’s opinion, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results. However, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to significant uncertainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Net Sales Fiscal years 2008 and 2007 spanned 52 weeks while fiscal year 2006 spanned 53 weeks. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The following table summarizes net sales and Mac unit sales by operating segment and net sales and unit sales by product during the three fiscal years ended September 27, 2008 (in millions, except unit sales in thousands and per unit amounts): 2008 Change 2007 Change 2006 Net Sales by Operating Segment: Americas net sales $ 14,573 26 % $ 11,596 23 % $ 9,415 Europe net sales 7,622 40 % 5,460 33 % 4,096 Japan net sales 1,509 39 % 1,082 (11 )% 1,211 Retail net sales 6,315 53 % 4,115 27 % 3,246 Other Segments net sales (a) 2,460 40 % 1,753 30 % 1,347 Total net sales $ 32,479 35 % $ 24,006 24 % $ 19,315 Unit Sales by Operating Segment: Americas Mac unit sales 3,980 32 % 3,019 24 % 2,432 Europe Mac unit sales 2,519 39 % 1,816 35 % 1,346 Japan Mac unit sales 389 29 % 302 (1 )% 304 Retail Mac unit sales 2,034 47 % 1,386 56 % 886 Other Segments Mac unit sales (a) 793 50 % 528 58 % 335 Total Mac unit sales 9,715 38 % 7,051 33 % 5,303 Net Sales by Product: Desktops (b) $ 5,603 39 % $ 4,020 21 % $ 3,319 Portables (c) 8,673 38 % 6,294 55 % 4,056 Total Mac net sales 14,276 38 % 10,314 40 % 7,375 iPod 9,153 10 % 8,305 8 % 7,676 Other music related products and services (d) 3,340 34 % 2,496 32 % 1,885 iPhone and related products and services (e) 1,844 N M 123 N M — Peripherals and other hardware (f) 1,659 32 % 1,260 15 % 1,100 Software, service, and other sales (g) 2,207 46 % 1,508 18 % 1,279 Total net sales $ 32,479 35 % $ 24,006 24 % $ 19,315 Unit Sales by Product: Desktops (b) 3,712 37 % 2,714 12 % 2,434 Portables (c) 6,003 38 % 4,337 51 % 2,869 Total Mac unit sales 9,715 38 % 7,051 33 % 5,303 Net sales per Mac unit sold (h) $ 1,469 — % $ 1,463 5 % $ 1,391 iPod unit sales 54,828 6 % 51,630 31 % 39,409 Net sales per iPod unit sold (i) $ 167 4 % $ 161 (17 )% $ 195 iPhone unit sales 11,627 N M 1,389 N M — 41 Table of Contents (a) Other Segments include Asia Pacific and FileMaker.

NM = Not Meaningful Fiscal Year 2008 versus 2007 Net sales during 2008 increased 35% or $8.5 billion from 2007. Several factors contributed to these increases including the following: • Mac net sales increased $4.0 billion or 38% during 2008 compared to 2007, while Mac unit sales increased by 2.7 million units or 38%. Net sales related to the Company’s Mac shipments accounted for 44% of the Company’s total net revenue. Higher Mac unit sales, which contributed to the increases in net sales, were driven by higher sales of all of the Company’s portable products as well as the popularity of the iMac, which experienced strong growth in net sales and unit sales in all of the Company’s reportable segments. Unit sales of the Company’s portable products accounted for 62% of the Company’s personal computer shipments in both 2008 and 2007. Net sales and unit sales of the Company’s portable products both increased by 38% during 2008 compared to 2007. This growth was attributable to strong demand for all the portable products, particularly the MacBook, which had double-digit growth in all of the Company’s operating segments, and the addition of the MacBook Air, which was introduced to the Company’s portable product line in January 2008. Growth of the Company’s desktop systems was also strong, with increased net sales and unit sales of 39% and 37%, respectively, during 2008 due primarily to strong sales of the iMac in all of the Company’s operating segments. • Net sales of iPods increased $848 million or 10% during 2008 compared to 2007 whereas unit sales of iPods increased 6% compared to 2007. The iPod unit growth was due to strong demand for the iPod touch, and to a lesser extent, higher unit sales of the iPod shuffle due to a price reduction in February 2008. iPod net sales grew faster than iPod unit sales due to higher average selling prices caused by a shift in overall iPod product mix to the higher priced iPod touch. • Net sales of iPhone and related products and services were $1.8 billion for 2008, with iPhone handset unit sales totaling 11.6 million. During 2008, sales of iPhone expanded beyond the U.S. and the Company expects to be shipping iPhones in over 70 countries by the end of December 2008. Net sales of iPhone and related products and services were $123 million in 2007, which represented sales for one fiscal quarter. iPhone net sales include the portion of handset revenue recognized in accordance with subscription accounting over the product’s 24-month estimated economic life, as well as revenue from sales of iPhone accessories and from carrier agreements. • Net sales of other music related products and services increased $844 million or 34% during the 2008 compared to 2007, due primarily to significantly increased net sales from the iTunes Store in each of the Company’s geographic segments. The Company believes this success is the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading third-party digital content, the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale and rent via the iTunes Store, and the launch of the iTunes App Store. The Company continues to expand its iTunes content offerings around the world. • Net sales of peripherals and other hardware increased $399 million or 32% compared to 2007 due to an increase in wireless networking products and other hardware accessories, including printers and scanners, which was partially offset by a decrease in net sales of displays. 42 Table of Contents • Net sales of software, service, and other sales rose $699 million or 46% during 2008 compared to 2007. This growth was due in large part to increased sales of Apple-branded and third-party developers’ software products and increased net sales of AppleCare Protection Plan (“APP”) extended service and support contracts. Fiscal Year 2007 versus 2006 Net sales during 2007 increased 24% or $4.7 billion from 2006 even though fiscal year 2007 spanned 52 weeks while fiscal year 2006 spanned 53 weeks. Several factors contributed to these increases including the following: • Mac net sales increased $3 billion or 40% during 2007 compared to 2006, while Mac unit sales increased by 1.75 million units or 33%. The 33% Mac unit sales growth rate is significantly greater than the estimated growth rate of the overall personal computer industry during that timeframe. Unit sales of the Company’s portable products accounted for 62% of the Company’s personal computer shipments in 2007, up from 54% in 2006. Net sales and unit sales of the Company’s portable products increased 55% and 51%, respectively, during 2007 compared to 2006. This growth was due to strong demand for the MacBook, which increased in each of the Company’s operating segments, as well as the MacBook Pro, which increased in each operating segment except Japan. Mac desktop net sales and unit sales increased by 21% and 12%, respectively, during 2007 due to stronger sales of the iMac in each of the Company’s operating segments. The Mac desktop net sales growth was greater than the unit sales growth due primarily to a shift in desktop product mix away from the lower-price Mac Mini and discontinued eMac and toward the iMac. • Net sales of iPods increased $629 million or 8% during 2007 compared to 2006. Unit sales of iPods increased 31% compared to 2006. The iPod growth was driven primarily by increased sales of the iPod shuffle and iPod nano particularly in international markets. iPod unit sales growth was significantly greater than iPod net sales due to a shift in overall iPod product mix, as well as due to lower selling prices for the iPod classic, iPod nano and iPod shuffle in 2007 compared to 2006. • Net sales of iPhone and related products and services were $123 million in 2007. iPhone net sales include the portion of iPhone handset revenue recognized in accordance with subscription accounting over the product’s 24-month estimated economic life, as well as sales of iPhone accessory products and revenue from carrier agreements. iPhone unit sales were 1.39 million in 2007. • Net sales of other music related products and services increased $611 million or 32% during 2007 compared to 2006 due to increased net sales from the iTunes Store. The Company believes this growth was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital content and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the iTunes Store. • Net sales of peripherals and other hardware increased $160 million or 15% compared to 2006 due to an increase in wireless networking products and other hardware accessories, including printers and scanners, which was partially offset by a decrease in net sales of displays. • Net sales of software, service, and other sales rose $229 million or 18% during 2007 compared to 2006. This growth was attributable primarily to increased net sales of APP extended service and support contracts and increased sales of Apple branded and third-party developers’ software products. Segment Operating Performance The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S. and in international markets. Each reportable geographic operating segment and the Retail operating segment provide similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Company’s operating segments may be found in Note 9, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. 43 Table of Contents Americas During 2008, net sales in the Americas segment increased $3.0 billion or 26% compared to 2007. The primary drivers of this growth were the significant year-over-year increase in sales of the iPod touch, Mac portable systems, content from the iTunes Store, and iPhone. The Company began shipping iPhone in June 2007 and the growth in iPhone sales in 2008 resulted from a full year of iPhone shipments. The increase in Mac net sales of $1.3 billion or 30% and Mac unit sales of 961 million or 32% is attributable to growth in all of the Mac portable systems, particularly the MacBook, and higher sales of the iMac. Net sales of iPods increased due to a shift in product mix toward higher priced iPods, particularly the iPod touch, which was upgraded in June 2008. In 2008, the Americas segment represented 45% of the Company’s total net sales as compared to 48% in the same period of 2007. During 2008, U.S. education channel net sales and Mac unit sales increased by 14% and 19%, respectively, compared to 2007. Net sales from the higher education market grew 15% during 2008 compared to 2007, while net sales in the K-12 market grew 12% during the same period. During 2007, net sales in the Americas segment increased $2.2 billion, or 23%, compared to 2006. The main sources of this growth were Mac portable products, iMacs, iPods, and the sales of third-party content from the iTunes Store. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to the popularity of the MacBook, introduced in May 2006 and updated in May 2007, as well as the MacBook Pro, introduced in January 2006 and updated in June 2007. Sales of iMacs grew due to a shift in desktop product mix away from the Mac mini and discontinued eMac as well as the strong reception of the new iMac introduced in August 2007. Sales of iPods grew due to increased demand for the iPod nano and iPod shuffle and the introduction of the iPod touch in September 2007. During 2007, the Americas segment represented 48% of the Company’s total net sales as compared to 49% in the same period of 2006. During 2007, U.S. education channel net sales and Mac unit sales increased by 14% and 18%, respectively, compared to 2006. Net sales from the higher education market grew 17% during 2007 compared to 2006, while net sales in the K-12 market grew 10% during the same period. Europe For 2008, net sales and unit sales in Europe increased 40% and 39%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2007. The main drivers of this growth were strong sales of Mac portable systems and iMac, increased sales from the iTunes Store, and iPhone. Also contributing to the increase in net sales were higher iPod net sales due primarily to the iPod touch, which was upgraded in June 2008. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to the MacBook Pro and the MacBook, both updated in February 2008, as well as the MacBook Air, introduced in January 2008. Mac desktop sales also increased due primarily to the popularity of the iMac, which was updated in April 2008. Sales from the iTunes Store grew substantially by 79% from 2007 as a result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital content and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the iTunes Store. The Europe segment represented 23% of total net sales in 2008, consistent with 2007. Europe segment net sales increased $1.4 billion or 33% during 2007 compared to 2006. Consistent with the Americas segment, the primary drivers of this growth were Mac portable products, iMacs, iPods, and the sales of third-party content from the iTunes Store. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to the popularity of both the MacBook and MacBook Pro. Sales of iMacs grew due to a shift in desktop product mix away from the Mac mini and discontinued eMac as well as the strong reception of the new iMac introduced in August 2007. Sales of iPods grew due primarily to increased demand for the iPod nano and iPod shuffle. The Company believes that the growth in iTunes Store sales was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital content and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the iTunes Store. Japan Japan net sales increased $427 million or 39% in 2008 compared to 2007. The primary contributors to the growth in net sales were increases in sales of iPods, iMac, Mac portable systems, and strong sales from the iTunes Store. Net sales, unit sales and the average selling price of iPods increased during 2008 compared to 2007, driven by strong demand for iPod touch and iPod nano. Additionally, Mac net sales and unit sales grew 42% and 29%, respectively, in 2008 compared to 2007 due to increase in sales of the iMac and Mac portable systems, particularly MacBook, as well as the introduction of MacBook Air in January 2008. 44 Table of Contents Japan’s net sales declined by $129 million or 11% in 2007 compared to 2006. Total Mac unit sales in Japan declined 1% during 2007. The decrease in the Japan segment’s overall net sales was attributable primarily to decreases in iPod and Mac desktop sales, partially offset by an increase in revenue from MacBooks and sales of third-party content from the iTunes Store. The decline in net sales and Mac unit sales is partially attributable to Japan’s declining consumer PC market, and the iPod sales decline is due primarily to lower average selling prices. The Company is continuing to evaluate ways to improve the future results of its Japan segment. Retail Retail net sales grew by 53% during 2008 compared to 2007, due in large part to increased sales of Mac portable and desktop products, strong demand for the iPhone and iPod touch, and new store openings. The Company opened 50 new retail stores during 2008, including a total of 19 international stores, bringing the total number of open stores to 247 as of September 27, 2008. This compares to 197 open stores as of September 29, 2007 and 165 open stores as of September 30, 2006. With an average of 211 stores and 178 stores opened during 2008 and 2007, respectively, average revenue per store increased to $29.9 million for 2008, compared to $23.1 million in 2007. Retail Mac net sales and Mac unit sales grew by 42% and 47%, respectively, during 2008 compared to the 2007, due primarily to strong demand for MacBook, iMac, and MacBook Air, introduced in January 2008. Net sales of iPods increased due to the popularity of the iPod touch, which was upgraded in June 2008, and a higher average selling price compared to 2007. The higher iPod average selling price was due to strong demand for the iPod touch. The Retail segment’s net sales increased by 27% to $4.1 billion during 2007 compared to 2006. Retail segment Mac unit sales increased 56% during 2007 as compared to 2006. With an average of 178 stores open during 2007, average revenue per store was $23.1 million, compared to $22.9 million in 2006. The increase in Retail segment net sales during 2007 compared to 2006 was due primarily to stronger sales of Mac portable products, iMacs, accessories and services. The increase was partially offset primarily by lower net sales of iPods and other music related products due to the expanded availability of those products through third-party resellers. As measured by the Company’s operating segment reporting, the Retail segment reported operating income of $1.3 billion during 2008 as compared to operating income of $875 million and $600 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. This improvement in 2008 was attributable primarily to the significant Retail net sales growth of 53% as compared to 2007. Expansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital asset purchases associated with the Retail segment were $389 million in 2008, bringing the total capital asset purchases since inception of the Retail segment to $1.4 billion. As of September 27, 2008, the Retail segment had approximately 15,900 full-time equivalent employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of $1.4 billion. The Company would incur substantial costs if it were to close multiple retail stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Other Segments The Company’s Other Segments, which consist of its Asia Pacific and FileMaker operations, experienced an increase in net sales of $707 million, or 40% during 2008 as compared to 2007. These increases are related primarily to strong growth in sales of all Mac portable systems, iPods, the iMac, and content from the iTunes Store in the Company’s Asia Pacific region. Sales from the iTunes Store in the Company’s Asia Pacific region grew significantly by 109% over 2007. Mac net sales and unit sales grew by 52% and 50%, respectively, due to increased sales of the iMac and all Mac portables. The Company’s Other Segments experienced an increase in net sales of $406 million, or 30% during 2007 compared to 2006. This increase related primarily to a 58% increase in sales of Mac portable products and strong iPod sales in the Company’s Asia Pacific region. 45 Table of Contents Gross Margin Gross margin for the three fiscal years ended September 27, 2008, are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages): 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 32,479 $ 24,006 $ 19,315 Cost of sales 21,334 15,852 13,717 Gross margin $ 11,145 $ 8,154 $ 5,598 Gross margin percentage 34.3% 34.0% 29.0% Gross margin percentage was relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007. Gross margin percentage of 34.0% in 2007 increased significantly from 29.0% in 2006. The primary drivers of this increase were more favorable costs on certain commodity components, including NAND flash memory and DRAM memory, higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs and a higher percentage of revenue from the Company’s direct sales channels. The Company expects its gross margin percentage to decrease in future periods compared to levels achieved during 2008 and 2007, and anticipates gross margin levels of about 30% in 2009. This expected decline is due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions, flat or reduced pricing on new and innovative products that have higher cost structures, both expected and potential future cost increases for key components, a stronger U.S. dollar, and higher logistical costs. The foregoing statements regarding the Company’s expected gross margin percentage are forward-looking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors, including but not limited to certain of those set forth below in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” under the subheading “Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities,” which is incorporated herein by reference. There can be no assurance that targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions and expected increases in the cost of key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (“DRAM”) and liquid crystal displays (“LCDs”), as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to these competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company’s significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three fiscal years ended September 27, 2008, are as follows (in millions, except for percentages): 2008 2007 2006 Research and development $ 1,109 $ 782 $ 712 Percentage of net sales 3.4% 3.3% 3.7% Selling, general, and administrative $ 3,761 $ 2,963 $ 2,433 Percentage of net sales 11.6% 12.3% 12.6% Research and Development (“R&D”) Expenditures for R&D increased 42% or $327 million to $1.1 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases were due primarily to an increase in R&D headcount in the current year to support expanded R&D activities and higher stock-based compensation expenses. In 2008, $11 million of software development costs were capitalized 46 Table of Contents related to Mac OS X Version 10.6 Snow Leopard and excluded from R&D expense, while R&D expense for 2007 excluded $75 million of capitalized software development costs related to Mac OS X Leopard and iPhone. Although total R&D expense increased 42% during 2008, it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 35% increase in revenue during 2008. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company’s core business strategy. As such, the Company expects to increase spending in R&D to remain competitive. Expenditures for R&D increased 10% or $70 million to $782 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The increases in R&D expense were due primarily to an increase in R&D headcount in 2007 to support expanded R&D activities, partially offset by one less week of expenses in the first quarter of 2007 and the capitalized software development costs mentioned above. Selling, General, and Administrative Expense (“SG&A”) Expenditures for SG&A increased $798 million or 27% to $3.8 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases are due primarily to higher stock-based compensation expenses, higher variable selling expenses resulting from the significant year-over-year increase in total net sales and the Company’s continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets. In addition, the Company incurred higher spending on marketing and advertising during 2008 compared to 2007. Expenditures for SG&A increased $530 million or 22% during 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was due primarily to higher direct and indirect channel variable selling expenses resulting from the significant year-over-year increase in total net sales in 2007, the Company’s continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets, and higher spending on marketing and advertising, partially offset by one less week of expenses in the first quarter of 2007. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense for the three fiscal years ended September 27, 2008, are as follows (in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Interest income $ 653 $ 647 $ 394 Other income (expense), net (33 ) (48 ) (29 ) Total other income and expense $ 620 $ 599 $ 365 Total other income and expense increased $21 million to $620 million during 2008 as compared to $599 million and $365 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. While the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances increased by 59% in 2008, other income and expense increased only 4% due to the decline in the weighted average interest rate earned of 3.44%. The overall increase in other income and expense is attributable to the Company’s higher cash and short-term investment balances, which more than offset the decline in interest rates during 2008 as compared to 2007. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments was 5.27% and 4.58% during 2007 and 2006, respectively. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense. Provision for Income Taxes The Company’s effective tax rates were 30% for the years ended September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, and 29% for the year ended September 30, 2006. The Company’s effective rates differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. As of September 27, 2008, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $2.1 billion before being offset against certain deferred liabilities for presentation on the Company’s balance sheet. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including 47 Table of Contents income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. The Company released a valuation allowance of $5 million since it has been determined that it is more likely than not the associated deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. The Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) has completed its field audit of the Company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements; it does not require any new fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. FAS 157-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13 and FSP No. FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157. FSP 157-1 amends SFAS No. 157 to remove certain leasing transactions from its scope. FSP 157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active, to clarify the application of SFAS 157 in inactive markets for financial assets. FSP 157-3 became effective upon issuance and SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 157, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not required to be measured at fair value. SFAS No. 159 requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings at each reporting date. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 159, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations, which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination. SFAS No. 141R also establishes principles around how goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase should be recognized and measured, as well as provides guidelines on the disclosure requirements on the nature and financial impact of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 141R, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. 48 Table of Contents In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, which requires companies to provide additional disclosures about its objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments, how the derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and related interpretations, and how the derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the Company’s financial statements. SFAS No. 161 also requires companies to disclose information about credit risk-related contingent features in their hedged positions. SFAS No. 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008 and is required to be adopted by the Company beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 161, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the three fiscal years ended September 27, 2008 (in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments $ 24,490 $ 15,386 $ 10,110 Accounts receivable, net $ 2,422 $ 1,637 $ 1,252 Inventory $ 509 $ 346 $ 270 Working capital $ 20,598 $ 12,676 $ 8,066 Annual operating cash flow $ 9,596 $ 5,470 $ 2,220 As of September 27, 2008, the Company had $24.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $9.1 billion from September 29, 2007. The principal components of this net increase were cash generated by operating activities of $9.6 billion, proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock plans of $483 million and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $757 million. These increases were partially offset by payments for acquisitions of property, plant, and equipment of $1.1 billion, payments made in connection with business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $220 million and payments for acquisitions of intangible assets of $108 million. The Company’s cash generated by operating activities significantly exceeded its net income due primarily to the large increase in deferred revenue, net of deferred costs, associated with subscription accounting for iPhone. The Company’s short-term investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly rated securities with a minimum rating of single-A. As of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, $11.3 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively, of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. The Company had $117 million in net unrealized losses on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities ranging from one to five years, as of September 27, 2008, and net unrealized losses of approximately $11 million on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities from one to five years, as of September 29, 2007. The Company has the intent and ability to hold such investments for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested. Accordingly, none of these declines in fair value were recognized in the Company’s Statement of Operations. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. Capital Assets The Company’s cash payments for capital asset purchases were $1.1 billion during 2008, consisting of $389 million for retail store facilities and $702 million for real estate acquisitions and corporate infrastructure including information systems enhancements. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $1.5 billion for capital asset purchases during 2009, including approximately $400 million for Retail facilities and approximately $1.1 billion for corporate facilities and infrastructure. 49 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company. The following table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of September 27, 2008 and excludes amounts already recorded on the Company’s balance sheet as current liabilities (in millions): Total Payments Duein LessThan 1 Year PaymentsDue in1-3 Years PaymentsDue in4-5 Years Payments Duein MoreThan 5 Years Operating leases $ 1,760 $ 195 $ 409 $ 368 $ 788 Purchase obligations 5,378 5,378 — — — Asset retirement obligations 28 — 8 7 13 Other obligations 471 242 124 105 — Total $ 7,637 $ 5,815 $ 541 $ 480 $ 801 Lease Commitments As of September 27, 2008, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of $1.8 billion, $1.4 billion of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. The Company’s major facility leases are generally for terms of 3 to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 1 to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. In addition, the Company has an off-balance sheet warranty obligation for products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No. 97-2 whereby the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. As of September 27, 2008, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments, component purchase commitments, and estimated warranty commitments of $5.4 billion. During 2006, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company prepaid $1.25 billion for flash memory components during 2006, which will be applied to certain inventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement. The Company utilized $567 million of the prepayment as of September 27, 2008. Asset Retirement Obligations The Company’s asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. As of September 27, 2008, the Company estimated that gross expected future cash flows of $28 million would be required to fulfill these obligations. 50 Table of Contents Other Obligations Other outstanding obligations were $471 million as of September 27, 2008, which related to advertising, research and development, Internet and telecommunications services, and other obligations. During the first quarter of 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48. The Company had historically classified interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits as current liabilities, but beginning with the adoption of FIN 48 the Company has reclassified gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 27, 2008, the Company recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $506 million and gross interest and penalties of $219 million, both of which are classified as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. Indemnifications The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 27, 2008 or September 29, 2007. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. However, given the effective horizons of the Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Interest Rate Risk While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries, the Company’s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. As such, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, the value of those investments, as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges. The Company’s short-term investment policy and strategy attempts primarily to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements. A portion of the Company’s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company’s investment policy and to an objective market benchmark. The Company’s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance, allowing for differences in liquidity needs. The Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company’s investment policy requires investments to be rated single-A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. All highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash 51 Table of Contents equivalents, while highly liquid investments with initial maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as short-term investments. As of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, approximately $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of the Company’s short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from one to five years. The remainder all had underlying maturities of less than 12 months. The Company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized no material net gains or losses during 2008, 2007 and 2006 related to such sales. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 27, 2008, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $46 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September 29, 2007, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $16 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. Foreign Currency Risk In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company’s practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for three to six months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. To provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 3,000 random market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $60 million as of September 27, 2008 compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $13 million as of September 29, 2007. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 27, 2008 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Company’s actual exposures and positions. 52 Table of Contents'"

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section and other parts of this Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “believes,” “plans,” “predicts,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the subsection entitled “Risk Factors” above, which are incorporated herein by reference. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. All information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references in this report to particular years or quarters refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Executive Overview The Company designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers, portable digital music players, and mobile communication devices and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company’s products and services include the Mac line of desktop and portable computers, the iPod line of portable digital music players, iPhone, Apple TV, Xserve, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the Mac OS X operating system, third-party digital content through the iTunes Store, and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Mac, iPod and iPhone compatible products, including application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and peripherals through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumer, small and mid-sized business (“SMB”), education, enterprise, government, and creative markets. 36 Table of Contents The Company is focused on providing innovative products and solutions to consumer, SMB, education, enterprise, government and creative customers that greatly enhance their evolving digital lifestyles. The Company is the only participant in the personal computer and consumer electronics industries that controls the design and development of the entire personal computer, including the hardware, operating system, and sophisticated software applications, as well as the design and development of portable digital music players, mobile communication devices, and a variety of products and solutions for obtaining and enjoying digital content. The Company is therefore uniquely positioned to offer superior and well-integrated digital lifestyle products and solutions, which are further enhanced by the Company’s emphasis on ease-of-use and creative industrial designs. The Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including personal computers with its Mac line of personal computers, consumer electronics with its iPod product families, mobile communications with iPhone, and distribution of third-party digital content through its online iTunes Store. While the Company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the personal computer and consumer electronics markets as well as a leader in the emerging market for distribution of digital content, these markets are highly competitive and subject to aggressive pricing. To remain competitive, the Company believes that increased investment in research and development and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain or expand its position in the markets where it competes. The Company’s R&D spending is focused on further developing its existing Mac line of personal computers, its operating system, application software, iPhone and iPods; developing new digital lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas and technologies. The Company also believes increased investment in marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand awareness. The Company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration, demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available only on Mac computers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the Mac with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company had 247 stores open as of September 27, 2008. The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales, including the Apple Sales Consultant Program, which places Apple employees and contractors at selected third-party reseller locations. The Company believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an efficient way to demonstrate the advantages of its Mac computers and other products over those of its competitors. The Company also sells to customers directly through its online stores around the world and through its direct sales force. The Company’s iPods are sold through a significant number of distribution points to provide broad access. iPods can be purchased in certain department stores, member-only warehouse stores, large retail chains, and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels for Mac distribution listed above. iPhone is distributed through the Company, its cellular network carriers’ distribution channels, and certain third-party resellers. The Company has signed multi-year agreements with various cellular network carriers authorizing them to distribute and provide cellular network services for iPhone 3G in over 70 countries. These agreements are generally not exclusive with a specific carrier, except in the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Spain, Ireland, and certain other countries. The Company expects to ship iPhone 3G in over 70 countries by the end of calendar year 2008. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts 37 Table of Contents reported in its Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. Management believes the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company’s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, music products, digital content, peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue for software products (operating system software and applications software), or any product that is considered to be software-related, in accordance with the guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) No. 03-5, Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Non-software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software, (e.g., Mac computers, iPod portable digital music players and iPhone) pursuant to American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) Statement of Position (“SOP”) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended. For products that are not software or software-related, (e.g., digital content sold on the iTunes Store and certain Mac, iPod and iPhone supplies and accessories), the Company recognizes revenue pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104, Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. For both Apple TV and iPhone, the Company has indicated that from time-to-time it may provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers. Therefore, sales of Apple TV and iPhone handsets are recognized under subscription accounting in accordance with SOP No. 97-2. The Company recognizes the associated revenue and cost of goods sold on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated 24-month economic lives of these products, with any loss recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred by the Company for engineering, sales, marketing, and warranty are expensed as incurred. The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Company’s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at 38 Table of Contents which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company’s historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company distributes its products through third-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and enterprise customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company’s direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit-risk-sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company’s distribution and retail channel partners. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management’s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that it reasonably believes to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors, including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the Company’s distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customer’s financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit-worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made. Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communications industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Company’s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs, which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs were recorded. The Company accrues reserves for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Company’s requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company’s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company’s products, the Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded. 39 Table of Contents Warranty Costs The Company provides for the estimated cost for hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company’s typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. For products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No. 97-2, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the Company’s results of operations. The Company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the software’s compliance with specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award’s fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) option-pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The BSM option-pricing model requires various judgmental assumptions including expected volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected option life. Significant changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the fair value of stock-based awards granted in the future. Income Taxes The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. Effective at the beginning of 2008, the Company adopted Financial Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. Further information may be found in Note 5, “Income Taxes” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of FIN 48 and other complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies As discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Note 8 “Commitments and Contingencies” in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is subject to 40 Table of Contents various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, the Company records a contingent liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In management’s opinion, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results. However, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to significant uncertainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Net Sales Fiscal years 2008 and 2007 spanned 52 weeks while fiscal year 2006 spanned 53 weeks. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The following table summarizes net sales and Mac unit sales by operating segment and net sales and unit sales by product during the three fiscal years ended September 27, 2008 (in millions, except unit sales in thousands and per unit amounts): 2008 Change 2007 Change 2006 Net Sales by Operating Segment: Americas net sales $ 14,573 26 % $ 11,596 23 % $ 9,415 Europe net sales 7,622 40 % 5,460 33 % 4,096 Japan net sales 1,509 39 % 1,082 (11 )% 1,211 Retail net sales 6,315 53 % 4,115 27 % 3,246 Other Segments net sales (a) 2,460 40 % 1,753 30 % 1,347 Total net sales $ 32,479 35 % $ 24,006 24 % $ 19,315 Unit Sales by Operating Segment: Americas Mac unit sales 3,980 32 % 3,019 24 % 2,432 Europe Mac unit sales 2,519 39 % 1,816 35 % 1,346 Japan Mac unit sales 389 29 % 302 (1 )% 304 Retail Mac unit sales 2,034 47 % 1,386 56 % 886 Other Segments Mac unit sales (a) 793 50 % 528 58 % 335 Total Mac unit sales 9,715 38 % 7,051 33 % 5,303 Net Sales by Product: Desktops (b) $ 5,603 39 % $ 4,020 21 % $ 3,319 Portables (c) 8,673 38 % 6,294 55 % 4,056 Total Mac net sales 14,276 38 % 10,314 40 % 7,375 iPod 9,153 10 % 8,305 8 % 7,676 Other music related products and services (d) 3,340 34 % 2,496 32 % 1,885 iPhone and related products and services (e) 1,844 N M 123 N M — Peripherals and other hardware (f) 1,659 32 % 1,260 15 % 1,100 Software, service, and other sales (g) 2,207 46 % 1,508 18 % 1,279 Total net sales $ 32,479 35 % $ 24,006 24 % $ 19,315 Unit Sales by Product: Desktops (b) 3,712 37 % 2,714 12 % 2,434 Portables (c) 6,003 38 % 4,337 51 % 2,869 Total Mac unit sales 9,715 38 % 7,051 33 % 5,303 Net sales per Mac unit sold (h) $ 1,469 — % $ 1,463 5 % $ 1,391 iPod unit sales 54,828 6 % 51,630 31 % 39,409 Net sales per iPod unit sold (i) $ 167 4 % $ 161 (17 )% $ 195 iPhone unit sales 11,627 N M 1,389 N M — 41 Table of Contents (a) Other Segments include Asia Pacific and FileMaker.

NM = Not Meaningful Fiscal Year 2008 versus 2007 Net sales during 2008 increased 35% or $8.5 billion from 2007. Several factors contributed to these increases including the following: • Mac net sales increased $4.0 billion or 38% during 2008 compared to 2007, while Mac unit sales increased by 2.7 million units or 38%. Net sales related to the Company’s Mac shipments accounted for 44% of the Company’s total net revenue. Higher Mac unit sales, which contributed to the increases in net sales, were driven by higher sales of all of the Company’s portable products as well as the popularity of the iMac, which experienced strong growth in net sales and unit sales in all of the Company’s reportable segments. Unit sales of the Company’s portable products accounted for 62% of the Company’s personal computer shipments in both 2008 and 2007. Net sales and unit sales of the Company’s portable products both increased by 38% during 2008 compared to 2007. This growth was attributable to strong demand for all the portable products, particularly the MacBook, which had double-digit growth in all of the Company’s operating segments, and the addition of the MacBook Air, which was introduced to the Company’s portable product line in January 2008. Growth of the Company’s desktop systems was also strong, with increased net sales and unit sales of 39% and 37%, respectively, during 2008 due primarily to strong sales of the iMac in all of the Company’s operating segments. • Net sales of iPods increased $848 million or 10% during 2008 compared to 2007 whereas unit sales of iPods increased 6% compared to 2007. The iPod unit growth was due to strong demand for the iPod touch, and to a lesser extent, higher unit sales of the iPod shuffle due to a price reduction in February 2008. iPod net sales grew faster than iPod unit sales due to higher average selling prices caused by a shift in overall iPod product mix to the higher priced iPod touch. • Net sales of iPhone and related products and services were $1.8 billion for 2008, with iPhone handset unit sales totaling 11.6 million. During 2008, sales of iPhone expanded beyond the U.S. and the Company expects to be shipping iPhones in over 70 countries by the end of December 2008. Net sales of iPhone and related products and services were $123 million in 2007, which represented sales for one fiscal quarter. iPhone net sales include the portion of handset revenue recognized in accordance with subscription accounting over the product’s 24-month estimated economic life, as well as revenue from sales of iPhone accessories and from carrier agreements. • Net sales of other music related products and services increased $844 million or 34% during the 2008 compared to 2007, due primarily to significantly increased net sales from the iTunes Store in each of the Company’s geographic segments. The Company believes this success is the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading third-party digital content, the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale and rent via the iTunes Store, and the launch of the iTunes App Store. The Company continues to expand its iTunes content offerings around the world. • Net sales of peripherals and other hardware increased $399 million or 32% compared to 2007 due to an increase in wireless networking products and other hardware accessories, including printers and scanners, which was partially offset by a decrease in net sales of displays. 42 Table of Contents • Net sales of software, service, and other sales rose $699 million or 46% during 2008 compared to 2007. This growth was due in large part to increased sales of Apple-branded and third-party developers’ software products and increased net sales of AppleCare Protection Plan (“APP”) extended service and support contracts. Fiscal Year 2007 versus 2006 Net sales during 2007 increased 24% or $4.7 billion from 2006 even though fiscal year 2007 spanned 52 weeks while fiscal year 2006 spanned 53 weeks. Several factors contributed to these increases including the following: • Mac net sales increased $3 billion or 40% during 2007 compared to 2006, while Mac unit sales increased by 1.75 million units or 33%. The 33% Mac unit sales growth rate is significantly greater than the estimated growth rate of the overall personal computer industry during that timeframe. Unit sales of the Company’s portable products accounted for 62% of the Company’s personal computer shipments in 2007, up from 54% in 2006. Net sales and unit sales of the Company’s portable products increased 55% and 51%, respectively, during 2007 compared to 2006. This growth was due to strong demand for the MacBook, which increased in each of the Company’s operating segments, as well as the MacBook Pro, which increased in each operating segment except Japan. Mac desktop net sales and unit sales increased by 21% and 12%, respectively, during 2007 due to stronger sales of the iMac in each of the Company’s operating segments. The Mac desktop net sales growth was greater than the unit sales growth due primarily to a shift in desktop product mix away from the lower-price Mac Mini and discontinued eMac and toward the iMac. • Net sales of iPods increased $629 million or 8% during 2007 compared to 2006. Unit sales of iPods increased 31% compared to 2006. The iPod growth was driven primarily by increased sales of the iPod shuffle and iPod nano particularly in international markets. iPod unit sales growth was significantly greater than iPod net sales due to a shift in overall iPod product mix, as well as due to lower selling prices for the iPod classic, iPod nano and iPod shuffle in 2007 compared to 2006. • Net sales of iPhone and related products and services were $123 million in 2007. iPhone net sales include the portion of iPhone handset revenue recognized in accordance with subscription accounting over the product’s 24-month estimated economic life, as well as sales of iPhone accessory products and revenue from carrier agreements. iPhone unit sales were 1.39 million in 2007. • Net sales of other music related products and services increased $611 million or 32% during 2007 compared to 2006 due to increased net sales from the iTunes Store. The Company believes this growth was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital content and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the iTunes Store. • Net sales of peripherals and other hardware increased $160 million or 15% compared to 2006 due to an increase in wireless networking products and other hardware accessories, including printers and scanners, which was partially offset by a decrease in net sales of displays. • Net sales of software, service, and other sales rose $229 million or 18% during 2007 compared to 2006. This growth was attributable primarily to increased net sales of APP extended service and support contracts and increased sales of Apple branded and third-party developers’ software products. Segment Operating Performance The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S. and in international markets. Each reportable geographic operating segment and the Retail operating segment provide similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Company’s operating segments may be found in Note 9, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. 43 Table of Contents Americas During 2008, net sales in the Americas segment increased $3.0 billion or 26% compared to 2007. The primary drivers of this growth were the significant year-over-year increase in sales of the iPod touch, Mac portable systems, content from the iTunes Store, and iPhone. The Company began shipping iPhone in June 2007 and the growth in iPhone sales in 2008 resulted from a full year of iPhone shipments. The increase in Mac net sales of $1.3 billion or 30% and Mac unit sales of 961 million or 32% is attributable to growth in all of the Mac portable systems, particularly the MacBook, and higher sales of the iMac. Net sales of iPods increased due to a shift in product mix toward higher priced iPods, particularly the iPod touch, which was upgraded in June 2008. In 2008, the Americas segment represented 45% of the Company’s total net sales as compared to 48% in the same period of 2007. During 2008, U.S. education channel net sales and Mac unit sales increased by 14% and 19%, respectively, compared to 2007. Net sales from the higher education market grew 15% during 2008 compared to 2007, while net sales in the K-12 market grew 12% during the same period. During 2007, net sales in the Americas segment increased $2.2 billion, or 23%, compared to 2006. The main sources of this growth were Mac portable products, iMacs, iPods, and the sales of third-party content from the iTunes Store. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to the popularity of the MacBook, introduced in May 2006 and updated in May 2007, as well as the MacBook Pro, introduced in January 2006 and updated in June 2007. Sales of iMacs grew due to a shift in desktop product mix away from the Mac mini and discontinued eMac as well as the strong reception of the new iMac introduced in August 2007. Sales of iPods grew due to increased demand for the iPod nano and iPod shuffle and the introduction of the iPod touch in September 2007. During 2007, the Americas segment represented 48% of the Company’s total net sales as compared to 49% in the same period of 2006. During 2007, U.S. education channel net sales and Mac unit sales increased by 14% and 18%, respectively, compared to 2006. Net sales from the higher education market grew 17% during 2007 compared to 2006, while net sales in the K-12 market grew 10% during the same period. Europe For 2008, net sales and unit sales in Europe increased 40% and 39%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2007. The main drivers of this growth were strong sales of Mac portable systems and iMac, increased sales from the iTunes Store, and iPhone. Also contributing to the increase in net sales were higher iPod net sales due primarily to the iPod touch, which was upgraded in June 2008. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to the MacBook Pro and the MacBook, both updated in February 2008, as well as the MacBook Air, introduced in January 2008. Mac desktop sales also increased due primarily to the popularity of the iMac, which was updated in April 2008. Sales from the iTunes Store grew substantially by 79% from 2007 as a result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital content and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the iTunes Store. The Europe segment represented 23% of total net sales in 2008, consistent with 2007. Europe segment net sales increased $1.4 billion or 33% during 2007 compared to 2006. Consistent with the Americas segment, the primary drivers of this growth were Mac portable products, iMacs, iPods, and the sales of third-party content from the iTunes Store. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to the popularity of both the MacBook and MacBook Pro. Sales of iMacs grew due to a shift in desktop product mix away from the Mac mini and discontinued eMac as well as the strong reception of the new iMac introduced in August 2007. Sales of iPods grew due primarily to increased demand for the iPod nano and iPod shuffle. The Company believes that the growth in iTunes Store sales was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital content and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the iTunes Store. Japan Japan net sales increased $427 million or 39% in 2008 compared to 2007. The primary contributors to the growth in net sales were increases in sales of iPods, iMac, Mac portable systems, and strong sales from the iTunes Store. Net sales, unit sales and the average selling price of iPods increased during 2008 compared to 2007, driven by strong demand for iPod touch and iPod nano. Additionally, Mac net sales and unit sales grew 42% and 29%, respectively, in 2008 compared to 2007 due to increase in sales of the iMac and Mac portable systems, particularly MacBook, as well as the introduction of MacBook Air in January 2008. 44 Table of Contents Japan’s net sales declined by $129 million or 11% in 2007 compared to 2006. Total Mac unit sales in Japan declined 1% during 2007. The decrease in the Japan segment’s overall net sales was attributable primarily to decreases in iPod and Mac desktop sales, partially offset by an increase in revenue from MacBooks and sales of third-party content from the iTunes Store. The decline in net sales and Mac unit sales is partially attributable to Japan’s declining consumer PC market, and the iPod sales decline is due primarily to lower average selling prices. The Company is continuing to evaluate ways to improve the future results of its Japan segment. Retail Retail net sales grew by 53% during 2008 compared to 2007, due in large part to increased sales of Mac portable and desktop products, strong demand for the iPhone and iPod touch, and new store openings. The Company opened 50 new retail stores during 2008, including a total of 19 international stores, bringing the total number of open stores to 247 as of September 27, 2008. This compares to 197 open stores as of September 29, 2007 and 165 open stores as of September 30, 2006. With an average of 211 stores and 178 stores opened during 2008 and 2007, respectively, average revenue per store increased to $29.9 million for 2008, compared to $23.1 million in 2007. Retail Mac net sales and Mac unit sales grew by 42% and 47%, respectively, during 2008 compared to the 2007, due primarily to strong demand for MacBook, iMac, and MacBook Air, introduced in January 2008. Net sales of iPods increased due to the popularity of the iPod touch, which was upgraded in June 2008, and a higher average selling price compared to 2007. The higher iPod average selling price was due to strong demand for the iPod touch. The Retail segment’s net sales increased by 27% to $4.1 billion during 2007 compared to 2006. Retail segment Mac unit sales increased 56% during 2007 as compared to 2006. With an average of 178 stores open during 2007, average revenue per store was $23.1 million, compared to $22.9 million in 2006. The increase in Retail segment net sales during 2007 compared to 2006 was due primarily to stronger sales of Mac portable products, iMacs, accessories and services. The increase was partially offset primarily by lower net sales of iPods and other music related products due to the expanded availability of those products through third-party resellers. As measured by the Company’s operating segment reporting, the Retail segment reported operating income of $1.3 billion during 2008 as compared to operating income of $875 million and $600 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. This improvement in 2008 was attributable primarily to the significant Retail net sales growth of 53% as compared to 2007. Expansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital asset purchases associated with the Retail segment were $389 million in 2008, bringing the total capital asset purchases since inception of the Retail segment to $1.4 billion. As of September 27, 2008, the Retail segment had approximately 15,900 full-time equivalent employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of $1.4 billion. The Company would incur substantial costs if it were to close multiple retail stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Other Segments The Company’s Other Segments, which consist of its Asia Pacific and FileMaker operations, experienced an increase in net sales of $707 million, or 40% during 2008 as compared to 2007. These increases are related primarily to strong growth in sales of all Mac portable systems, iPods, the iMac, and content from the iTunes Store in the Company’s Asia Pacific region. Sales from the iTunes Store in the Company’s Asia Pacific region grew significantly by 109% over 2007. Mac net sales and unit sales grew by 52% and 50%, respectively, due to increased sales of the iMac and all Mac portables. The Company’s Other Segments experienced an increase in net sales of $406 million, or 30% during 2007 compared to 2006. This increase related primarily to a 58% increase in sales of Mac portable products and strong iPod sales in the Company’s Asia Pacific region. 45 Table of Contents Gross Margin Gross margin for the three fiscal years ended September 27, 2008, are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages): 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 32,479 $ 24,006 $ 19,315 Cost of sales 21,334 15,852 13,717 Gross margin $ 11,145 $ 8,154 $ 5,598 Gross margin percentage 34.3% 34.0% 29.0% Gross margin percentage was relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007. Gross margin percentage of 34.0% in 2007 increased significantly from 29.0% in 2006. The primary drivers of this increase were more favorable costs on certain commodity components, including NAND flash memory and DRAM memory, higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs and a higher percentage of revenue from the Company’s direct sales channels. The Company expects its gross margin percentage to decrease in future periods compared to levels achieved during 2008 and 2007, and anticipates gross margin levels of about 30% in 2009. This expected decline is due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions, flat or reduced pricing on new and innovative products that have higher cost structures, both expected and potential future cost increases for key components, a stronger U.S. dollar, and higher logistical costs. The foregoing statements regarding the Company’s expected gross margin percentage are forward-looking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors, including but not limited to certain of those set forth below in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” under the subheading “Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities,” which is incorporated herein by reference. There can be no assurance that targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions and expected increases in the cost of key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (“DRAM”) and liquid crystal displays (“LCDs”), as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to these competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company’s significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three fiscal years ended September 27, 2008, are as follows (in millions, except for percentages): 2008 2007 2006 Research and development $ 1,109 $ 782 $ 712 Percentage of net sales 3.4% 3.3% 3.7% Selling, general, and administrative $ 3,761 $ 2,963 $ 2,433 Percentage of net sales 11.6% 12.3% 12.6% Research and Development (“R&D”) Expenditures for R&D increased 42% or $327 million to $1.1 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases were due primarily to an increase in R&D headcount in the current year to support expanded R&D activities and higher stock-based compensation expenses. In 2008, $11 million of software development costs were capitalized 46 Table of Contents related to Mac OS X Version 10.6 Snow Leopard and excluded from R&D expense, while R&D expense for 2007 excluded $75 million of capitalized software development costs related to Mac OS X Leopard and iPhone. Although total R&D expense increased 42% during 2008, it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 35% increase in revenue during 2008. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company’s core business strategy. As such, the Company expects to increase spending in R&D to remain competitive. Expenditures for R&D increased 10% or $70 million to $782 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The increases in R&D expense were due primarily to an increase in R&D headcount in 2007 to support expanded R&D activities, partially offset by one less week of expenses in the first quarter of 2007 and the capitalized software development costs mentioned above. Selling, General, and Administrative Expense (“SG&A”) Expenditures for SG&A increased $798 million or 27% to $3.8 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases are due primarily to higher stock-based compensation expenses, higher variable selling expenses resulting from the significant year-over-year increase in total net sales and the Company’s continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets. In addition, the Company incurred higher spending on marketing and advertising during 2008 compared to 2007. Expenditures for SG&A increased $530 million or 22% during 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was due primarily to higher direct and indirect channel variable selling expenses resulting from the significant year-over-year increase in total net sales in 2007, the Company’s continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets, and higher spending on marketing and advertising, partially offset by one less week of expenses in the first quarter of 2007. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense for the three fiscal years ended September 27, 2008, are as follows (in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Interest income $ 653 $ 647 $ 394 Other income (expense), net (33 ) (48 ) (29 ) Total other income and expense $ 620 $ 599 $ 365 Total other income and expense increased $21 million to $620 million during 2008 as compared to $599 million and $365 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. While the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances increased by 59% in 2008, other income and expense increased only 4% due to the decline in the weighted average interest rate earned of 3.44%. The overall increase in other income and expense is attributable to the Company’s higher cash and short-term investment balances, which more than offset the decline in interest rates during 2008 as compared to 2007. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments was 5.27% and 4.58% during 2007 and 2006, respectively. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense. Provision for Income Taxes The Company’s effective tax rates were 30% for the years ended September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, and 29% for the year ended September 30, 2006. The Company’s effective rates differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. As of September 27, 2008, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $2.1 billion before being offset against certain deferred liabilities for presentation on the Company’s balance sheet. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including 47 Table of Contents income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. The Company released a valuation allowance of $5 million since it has been determined that it is more likely than not the associated deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. The Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) has completed its field audit of the Company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements; it does not require any new fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. FAS 157-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13 and FSP No. FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157. FSP 157-1 amends SFAS No. 157 to remove certain leasing transactions from its scope. FSP 157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active, to clarify the application of SFAS 157 in inactive markets for financial assets. FSP 157-3 became effective upon issuance and SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 157, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not required to be measured at fair value. SFAS No. 159 requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings at each reporting date. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 159, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations, which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination. SFAS No. 141R also establishes principles around how goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase should be recognized and measured, as well as provides guidelines on the disclosure requirements on the nature and financial impact of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 141R, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. 48 Table of Contents In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, which requires companies to provide additional disclosures about its objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments, how the derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and related interpretations, and how the derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the Company’s financial statements. SFAS No. 161 also requires companies to disclose information about credit risk-related contingent features in their hedged positions. SFAS No. 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008 and is required to be adopted by the Company beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 161, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the three fiscal years ended September 27, 2008 (in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments $ 24,490 $ 15,386 $ 10,110 Accounts receivable, net $ 2,422 $ 1,637 $ 1,252 Inventory $ 509 $ 346 $ 270 Working capital $ 20,598 $ 12,676 $ 8,066 Annual operating cash flow $ 9,596 $ 5,470 $ 2,220 As of September 27, 2008, the Company had $24.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $9.1 billion from September 29, 2007. The principal components of this net increase were cash generated by operating activities of $9.6 billion, proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock plans of $483 million and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $757 million. These increases were partially offset by payments for acquisitions of property, plant, and equipment of $1.1 billion, payments made in connection with business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $220 million and payments for acquisitions of intangible assets of $108 million. The Company’s cash generated by operating activities significantly exceeded its net income due primarily to the large increase in deferred revenue, net of deferred costs, associated with subscription accounting for iPhone. The Company’s short-term investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly rated securities with a minimum rating of single-A. As of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, $11.3 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively, of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. The Company had $117 million in net unrealized losses on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities ranging from one to five years, as of September 27, 2008, and net unrealized losses of approximately $11 million on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities from one to five years, as of September 29, 2007. The Company has the intent and ability to hold such investments for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested. Accordingly, none of these declines in fair value were recognized in the Company’s Statement of Operations. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. Capital Assets The Company’s cash payments for capital asset purchases were $1.1 billion during 2008, consisting of $389 million for retail store facilities and $702 million for real estate acquisitions and corporate infrastructure including information systems enhancements. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $1.5 billion for capital asset purchases during 2009, including approximately $400 million for Retail facilities and approximately $1.1 billion for corporate facilities and infrastructure. 49 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company. The following table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of September 27, 2008 and excludes amounts already recorded on the Company’s balance sheet as current liabilities (in millions): Total Payments Duein LessThan 1 Year PaymentsDue in1-3 Years PaymentsDue in4-5 Years Payments Duein MoreThan 5 Years Operating leases $ 1,760 $ 195 $ 409 $ 368 $ 788 Purchase obligations 5,378 5,378 — — — Asset retirement obligations 28 — 8 7 13 Other obligations 471 242 124 105 — Total $ 7,637 $ 5,815 $ 541 $ 480 $ 801 Lease Commitments As of September 27, 2008, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of $1.8 billion, $1.4 billion of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. The Company’s major facility leases are generally for terms of 3 to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 1 to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. In addition, the Company has an off-balance sheet warranty obligation for products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No. 97-2 whereby the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. As of September 27, 2008, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments, component purchase commitments, and estimated warranty commitments of $5.4 billion. During 2006, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company prepaid $1.25 billion for flash memory components during 2006, which will be applied to certain inventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement. The Company utilized $567 million of the prepayment as of September 27, 2008. Asset Retirement Obligations The Company’s asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. As of September 27, 2008, the Company estimated that gross expected future cash flows of $28 million would be required to fulfill these obligations. 50 Table of Contents Other Obligations Other outstanding obligations were $471 million as of September 27, 2008, which related to advertising, research and development, Internet and telecommunications services, and other obligations. During the first quarter of 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48. The Company had historically classified interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits as current liabilities, but beginning with the adoption of FIN 48 the Company has reclassified gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 27, 2008, the Company recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $506 million and gross interest and penalties of $219 million, both of which are classified as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. Indemnifications The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September 27, 2008 or September 29, 2007. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. However, given the effective horizons of the Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results. Interest Rate Risk While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world’s leading industrialized countries, the Company’s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. As such, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, the value of those investments, as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges. The Company’s short-term investment policy and strategy attempts primarily to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements. A portion of the Company’s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company’s investment policy and to an objective market benchmark. The Company’s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance, allowing for differences in liquidity needs. The Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company’s investment policy requires investments to be rated single-A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. All highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash 51 Table of Contents equivalents, while highly liquid investments with initial maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as short-term investments. As of September 27, 2008 and September 29, 2007, approximately $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of the Company’s short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from one to five years. The remainder all had underlying maturities of less than 12 months. The Company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized no material net gains or losses during 2008, 2007 and 2006 related to such sales. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 27, 2008, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $46 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September 29, 2007, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $16 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. Foreign Currency Risk In general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company’s practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for three to six months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments. To provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 3,000 random market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $60 million as of September 27, 2008 compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $13 million as of September 29, 2007. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 27, 2008 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Company’s actual exposures and positions. 52 Table of Contents'}]"
